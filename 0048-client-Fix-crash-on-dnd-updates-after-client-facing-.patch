Subject: [PATCH 48/57] client: Fix crash on dnd updates after client facing
 drag ends

A platform drag and a application-facing drag have two different
lifespans.

The platform drag lasts until all mimedata is transferred and the client
receiving the drops marks it as finished.

The application facing QDrag lasts until the client deletes it. We can
get a crash if we get updates during this time.

The drop event is guarded, but not the action negotiation.

Pick-to: 6.6
